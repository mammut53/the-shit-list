## The List

### Adobe Cloud Web

Adobe Cloud for assets, share them etc.

#### Reasons
1. You want to download a folder: Nope, you can't do this at all. You can only download files. This feature has been requested first in 2012 in this post [here](https://forums.adobe.com/thread/1030495). Luckily, the Creative Cloud Desktop App can do this.

### Minecraft 1.13

An unknown game by... I think ...a guy named Markus Persson.

#### Reasons
1. Amazing [command system](https://github.com/Mojang/brigadier) which lacks native support in [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/).
2. Every command block construction is broken completely. [Reddit post by Dinnerbone](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dinnerbone/comments/6l6e3d/a_completely_incomplete_super_early_preview_of/)

### Windows 10

Microsoft operating system, like MS-DOS.

#### Reasons
1. If you set your PC to sleeping mode in the evening and Windows thinks: I would like to download/apply an update. It turns the computer back on and does it's stuff. In the morning, after you had a magically refreshing sleep, you notice that your PC is still/again on! RIP climate
